After many hours in front of the screens I'm beginning to see the site taking form and soon ready to publish it on github pages. Before this course I'd never heard of static sites or Jekyll. I'd heard of Docker and SASS but didn't know what it was. So now after a few weeks getting acquainted to first the environment of Docker and then the structure of a Jekyll site and last to learn the syntax of markdown and SASS. 
I've enjoyed working with these tools and I think their good tools that I can use more in the future. I'm already thinking about using Jekyll in web project that I'm starting next year. Well see.

  description: I started a company named Avshoppen where I sold home electronics via the webshop. 
               I built the company from scratch and I did everything from setting up the shop, working with distributors and setting up campaigns. 
               I shipped the products and was managing the support. After a year I merged with a physical home electronics store in Staffanstorp called Ljud & Bild.
               And continued in doing so until the shops were closed in 2013.

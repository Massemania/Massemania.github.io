## Presentation av mig
My name is Mats Magnusson and I'm 43 years old. I live in Malmö with my girlfriend Jessica and our cat Muscoth.
I have a lot of interests, my favorite ones is IT, trading (stocks and futures), sports, music and concerts, travel and hang out with friends and family.
I've been working in sales for many years, it started as an internship in a record store many years ago and I continued on to be a salesman in different homelectronics stores. I've produced several different webshops from nothing and made them grow to be succesful and been an owner of a couple different physical stores also. IT has been a passion for me since I was about ten years old, I've owned all possible different computers over the years. Through the years I've created a couple of blogs, mostly with wordpress. Last year I started thinking more and  more if I should start a new career and become a developer. I wrote my first code in april of this year when I started a full stack developer course and I been trying to improve my skills since then. The first part of the course was a 16 week of poking att different languages and after that 12 week intership. Right now I'm in the middle of the intership (ending in december) at IBM CIC in Malmö as a developer. It's been an autumn filled with hardwork and a little sacrifice, its tough to work 100% and study 100% at the same time. But I'm not complaining, I love what I do. But time is not a luxury I have at the moment.
I am the person who everybody in mt family calls when they have a computer issue. I've worked in Windows OS for many years since 3.11 days, you could say that I'm a computer nerd. My programming skills are evolving every day, but I also know that I have much, much more to learn. My motto in life is to have fun, enjoy life! And to do things that inspires me and doing this with a lot of passion. 
As a person I'm very goal oriented and disciplined. I like to set goals and working towards them with a lot determination. I love to be challenged and I'm a positive by nature. When I get inspired sometimes I loose track of time and can only see the goal, for example when I'm developing new trading strategies. When that happens I can get stuck with my computer for a long time...

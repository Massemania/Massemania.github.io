description: In this app, the task was to write a web scraper that scrapes but also analyzes information on some web sites built especially for this assignment. The idea was that I was going to write a scraper/agent that solves a specific problem. I got the main page to proceed from, which links to three different web sites. I had to analyze the three different sites and how the HTML are rendered an form my HTTP request regarding to that.
